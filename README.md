# Wine Festival Schedule

In this project, you will use a table to layout the schedule for a fictional wine festival.

## Tasks

1. In index.html, inside of the ``<div>`` with class container, create a new ``<table>`` element.
2. Inside of the `<table>` element, add a `<thead>` element. Put two `<tr>` elements inside of the `<thead>` element.
3. Inside the first `<tr>` you made in the previous step, add a `<th>`. Inside of that, include an `<h1>` with the following text: Wine Festival Schedule.
4. Inside the second `<tr>` that you made in Step 2, add two `<th>`s. Inside the first, include an `<h2>` that says Time. Inside the second, include an `<h2>` that says Event.
5. You may notice that "Wine Festival Schedule" does not stretch across the entire table. In the opening `<th>` tag of this element, add colspan=2.
6. Below the closing `</thead>` tag, add opening and closing `<tbody>` tags.
7. Inside of the `<tbody>` element you created in the previous step, create 5 table rows using the `<tr>` tag.
8. Inside each `<tr>`, create two cells using the `<td>` tag. The first `<td>` element in each row should have the class left.
9. Inside the `<td class="left">` elements, add `<h3>` elements that include times from 12:00 PM to 04:00 PM.
10. In each `<td>` element that does not have the class left, include the event that corresponds with the time.
